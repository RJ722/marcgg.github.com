## coverage - wow, so accurate - we need it...?
When this phase kicked in, I was still wrapping my head around coverage - My plan was
to get coverage integrated with Vulture, which would allow users to "transfer" the results
from coverage to Vulture so that the false positives were automatically detected and thereby
supressed. It sounded so neat and moreso doable (using an interminnent xml file) and so naturally, I just
quickly got down to nuts and bolts and started a Pull Request. But, alongst those splendid colors
of awesome functionality, Jendrik comes in and talks a bunch on why we shouldn't do it. I could
extrapolate the following reasons:
* We already created an easier, dynamic and robust way to create and manage whitelists (`--make-whitelist`)
  which shall eliminate the need of having 10 different things for dealing with false positives.
* Coverage is a tool for dynamic analysis (which requires your code to be actually run) and is
  therefore slow, but gives much more accurate results. And, if we already have results from coverage,
  why would we then need Vulture for??
* Vulture is supposed to be a static analysis tool.
* Vulture would've no longer been independent of external modules.

But, still it struck me as a little odd at that time because I thought that the functionality was optional and if someone
didn't want it, he would simply just not use it - simple. By now, may be you've judged that
that this was the _"feature syndrome"_ talking (The more features we have, the more usable we are) and yes, you're right.
Luckily, Jendrik foresaw this early and redirected me towards [http://neugierig.org/software/blog/2018/07/options](this blog post)
which explains why it's actually toxic for anything to have more "options" and how it was an expensive process in terms of
time spent on writing, documenting and maintaining it.

I'm very thankful of Jendrik and proud of the fact that we've still managed to keep the workflow
involved when using `Vulture` as simple as it could get. :-)
