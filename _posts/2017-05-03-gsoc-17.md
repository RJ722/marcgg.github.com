Hello, This post is a brief description of what is GSoC and how I wrote my project proposal for GSoC

## What exactly is GSoC?

GSoc stands for Google Summer of code. It is an annual programming event which encourages students at University
level to contribute more to open source. A student gets many perks if he successfully completes his/her project
including:
* A **mentor** to learn from.
* Stipend (2400 USD for three months in India) - quite a big deal.
* Referrals when you apply for a job at Google.
* Contacts with programmers round the world.
* A kickstart guide which motivates you to get started on open source development.

## My experience with GSoC

After going rounds through the organisations list for GSoC and shortlisting them on the basis of how much do I fit in
the requirements and lurking around in the IRC channel, chat room. Now, reading past messages in  coala’s gitter room,
I knew one thing for  sure - people here are  absolutely beginner  friendly. Also, the  documentation  and  management
structure was so proper that it  was easy to get  started with and I  almost completely  fitted  in  the  requirements
section. So, I finally realised that I need to work with the coala community.

Initially, I did a beginner issue, which some minor change in the documentation. Since, I had been using unittest for
a while, I tried to do something creative while porting  from pytest to unittest.  But the porting  was objected upon
and it did seem  legit ([Here's the link](https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/3894)). I tried to solve a couple of more issues.  Review system is  wonderful here.
Now, since I was interested in the vulture project, I started exploring vulture. It took me around four to five hours
of consolidation to get  familiar with the code base. Then, I also started working on the project  proposal, tried to
have a big picture in my mind on how we could possibly implement the VultureBear. Jendrik - my mentor, creator and
maintainer of vulture helped me immensely throughout the phase by giving his expert critique. Thank you [@jendrik](https://github.com/jendrikseipp)

Some of the college alumni and my friends helped me with finalising an initial draft. I made sure everything was in
place and finally submitted it for feedback. Maintainers at coala are so awesome that they even managed proposal
review system through which we could submit the link for the draft and they would give feedback within a day or two.
After getting it reviewed a couple of times, I finally submitted a PDF a day before.

### An incident which happened during the application phase:
It was just one day left for submitting the proposal and the proof of enrolment when I uploaded the proposal and the
affidavit one of my professor had prepared (for proof of enrolment) and then went straight to bed. The next day was
quite a long day at college and then I had a seminar to attend, so it was around 21:15 when I rang the doorbell. Now,
for some reason, before having dinner I decided to open my laptop first and as soon as I open chrome, I see an email
from John that you haven’t submitted a proof of enrolment yet. I was quite shocked and the clock rang 21:20 at the
time. I suspect this was because of slow internet speed the day before. But anyways, I was able to upload it
successfully on time (owe this to John).

I later come to see that John had literally messaged me everywhere he could to notify me about the scenario. (He
emailed me, commented on the project proposal, messaged me on hangout, public coala channel and even PM’d me on
gitter.)

A big thank you [@jayvdb](https://github.com/jayvdb), I have no words to express my gratitude.


## Some Remarks:

During the application phase, I was often distracted by a feeling of letting it go - I won’t be selected anyways. But
people at coala are generous. ;P. On a more serious note, **We should always believe in ourselves**. If we
think of ourselves as under qualified, or *we still don’t know enough*, this would only strengthen the
procrastination and ultimately, we may not even apply. We should never miss an opportunity.

My mom helped me by believing in me. Thank You Mom


Thank you for reading along. I'll be posting my project specific details in a seperate post.
