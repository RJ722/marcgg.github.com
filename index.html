<h1>Hello!</h1>
<div class="published">
  <span>I learn, I write, I speak - It's mostly about open source, python or robotics.

   <p>
    I am a sophomore at <a href="https://www.amu.ac.in/principal.jsp?did=10147">Zakir Husain College of Engineering and Technology</a>, studying Electronics Engineering. I advocate the principles of FLOSS (Free and Libre Open Source Software) and therefore, along with some seniors, I co-founded an open source software society at college, AMU-OSS with the aim of bringing more and more people to contribute to upstream software. I am afraid of the risks that online surveillance poses on us and thereby commend safe surfing of the Internet, i.e. at the very least using duckduckgo for search, using torBrowser, etc.

<h3>Hobbies</h3>

<ul>
<li>
    <b>Robotics</b>
    <p>
        I took up Engineering because of my passion for Autonomous Robots - They fascinate me, leave me overwhelmed every time I realise the complicated intricacies of machinery which empowers our brain.
    </p>
</li>
<li>
    <b>Working on Open Source Projects</b>
    <p>
        Other than learning/pondering about Robots, I help maintain <a href="https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture">vulture</a>, a tool which helps find dead code in Python Programs, and <a href="coala.io">coala</a>, a language independent static analysis tool and a linter. I was selected as a <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/projects/5154725527814144/">Google Summer of Code student</a> with coala twice in 2017 and in 2018, which was indeed a great experience. I believe that pursuing open source is one of the best ways I can give back to the society, teaching what I learned from it. If you too feel like that you need some help regarding how to get started with contributing to open source software, write to me straight away at (<a href="malito:rahul@rj722.tech">rahul [AT] rj722 [DOT] tech</a>)
    </p>
</li>

<li>
    <b>Reading</b>
    <p>
        I like to learn new things and that is why I read, a lot about tech and yet more about the open source movement. I also like poetry and plan to start reading literature soon.
    </p>
</li>

<li>
    <b><b>Not</b> using (i.e. not getting used) by facebook</b>
    <p>
        I didn't appreciate facebook back when I was a kid, particularly because of it's addicting nature and how I ended up reading jokes or laughing at someone else's very old pics. It appeared to be a huge waste of time so I stopped using it.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a grown up, I don't like it either, but for a very different reason - The amount of information they track (without my consent) is huge and I believe that this (subconsciously) changes my behavior online, which is certainly not acceptable nor preferable. I am particularly pointing towards Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Google. My facebook account is a fallback one - I use it <i>only</i> when I have to lookup an event or in case of an emergency where I need someone's contact information immediately.
    </p>

        Please refer to <a href="https://stallman.org/facebook.html">https://stallman.org/facebook.html</a> for more reasons on not using (getting used by) facebook.
    </p>

<li>
    <b>Going to meetups and conferences</b>
    <p>
        I've a lot of fun at conferences - whether I am an attendee or an organizer, either way I get to meet and learn from like minded people. I also host regular meetups through AMU-OSS, where anyone from the audience is welcome to come and speak about whatever she's been working on lately.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was invited as a speaker in PyCon India 2017 where I spoke about "Reducing Dead Code Ratio of Python Projects using vulture". I also delivered a lightening talk on "coala - What, why and How?", met quite a few celebrities in the Python community and made a lot of friends during the same conference.
    </p>

</ul>

<p>
    Some of my other hobbies include:
<ul>
    <li> Writing - I update this blog once in a while. I write in my <a href="https://rahuls-diary.herokuapp.com">diary</a>, much more often.</li>
    <li> Configuring and trying out different themes and desktop environments. </li>
    <li> Gtypist - Learning to touch type </li>
</ul>
